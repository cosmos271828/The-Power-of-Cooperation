Evolution of Cooperation

This is a Python program for studying the evolution of cooperation in iterated prisoner's dilemma scenarios. Run "main.py" and follow instructions to run the simulation. You can write more custom strategies in "functions.py" by writing a function for the strategy, adding the function name to the global variable "available_players" and to the function "find_move". "test.py" contains some tests where randomness of the simulation is removed.
